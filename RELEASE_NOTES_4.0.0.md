# BrainCoinz v4.0.0 - Coinz Economy System Release

**Release Date**: December 2024  
**Version**: 4.0.0 (Build 4)  
**Compatibility**: iOS 16.0+  

## 🎉 Major New Features

### 🪙 **Coinz Economy System**
Transform screen time management into an engaging learning economy! Children now earn virtual Coinz through educational app usage and spend them to unlock entertainment apps, creating a balanced system that rewards learning while maintaining healthy screen time boundaries.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Motivates Learning**: Children are incentivized to use educational apps to earn Coinz
- **Teaches Financial Responsibility**: Kids learn to save, spend, and budget their virtual currency
- **Maintains Healthy Limits**: Coinz spending is still constrained by parent-set daily time limits
- **Encourages Planning**: Cumulative system allows saving Coinz for bigger rewards

### ⚖️ **Balanced Economy Design**
The system creates a perfect balance between freedom and responsibility:

- **Cumulative Coinz**: Unused Coinz carry over to the next day, never expiring
- **Time Limit Constraints**: Even with lots of Coinz, daily screen time is controlled by parent limits
- **Three-Tier Validation**: Learning requirement → Coinz balance → Daily time limits
- **Parent Oversight**: Full control over child's balance with adjustment capabilities
